        * What is the best way to hook into the LevelManager and do a ton of game specific work before Fading Up...
            * Have a scriptable object full of level settings (rig state, available weapons, etc), and it implements an interface bool IRun().  It returns true it's done, and false when it's not.  Then LevelManager has a RegisterWork? 
            * Maybe it's better to have LevelManager.RegisterReady, and the interface is IReady, with property bool IsReady { get; }.  That way anything can register itself with the LevelManager in IAwake or IStart and as long as it's not ready, Level Manager won't finish and Fade Up.  Under the hood, the class could use any method for running the code over time.  Coroutine or WorkManager.
